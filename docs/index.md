# DBCLS BioHackathon 2024

## Objectives

### Accelerate data science through the integrated use of databases in life sciences.

The BioHackathon in Japan, hosted by the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS), prioritizes research topics that focus on the integrated use of databases in life sciences. Our focus is continuously on the standardization and interoperability of life sciences and biomedical databases (knowledge graphs). Simultaneously, by combining innovative approaches with information from literature, we aim to enable new discoveries through the development of methods and applications in data science.

To make the BioHackathon event more collaborative for all participants within a short time period, we have decided to limit the number of hacking topics. Having too many projects would limit interaction between them, so we will mainly focus on the following areas of research interest:

* [R1] Multi-omics analysis on human genotype to phenotype that includes genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, protein structures, and biochemical data.
* [R2] Automated data analysis of microorganisms including phylogenetic compositions, gene annotations, pathways, and growth conditions.
* [R3] Data-driven interdisciplinary studies in public health, environment, agriculture, food, energy, and other fields.
* [R4] Facilitating knowledge discovery and biological analysis of knowledge graphs and literature.
